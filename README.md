PROJECT IN ADVANCED ROBOTICS

**Recognizing Plants to Adjust Irrigation**

This project aims to enhance agricultural efficiency and sustainability by developing a system that recognizes plant species and monitors their health conditions in real time. By leveraging drones equipped with high-resolution cameras and advanced machine learning models, the system provides actionable insights for optimizing irrigation practices.

The system integrates YOLOv8s for plant species detection and MobileNetV2 for health assessment, allowing for precise water management tailored to individual plant needs. This innovative approach addresses the inefficiencies of traditional irrigation systems, reducing water waste, improving crop health, and supporting sustainable farming practices across diverse agricultural environments.
